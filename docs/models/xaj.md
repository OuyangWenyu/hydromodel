# XinAnJiang (XAJ) Model

XinAnJiang (XAJ) model is one of the most famous conceptual hydrological models, especially popular in Southern China. It was developed by Prof. Renjun Zhao and has been widely used for rainfall-runoff simulation and flood forecasting.

## Model Structure

The XAJ model consists of three main components:

1. **Evapotranspiration Module**: Three-layer evaporation model
2. **Runoff Generation Module**: Soil moisture accounting and runoff calculation  
3. **Flow Routing Module**: Unit hydrograph and flow routing
